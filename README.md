# PromptCriticality

Red particles are ready to undergo fission, blue particles are depleted. Magenta particles represent neutrons.

**Arrow keys** to move around, **Left Shift** and **Left Ctrl** control zoom.

**Click on a red particle** to manually ignite fission, or wait until a spontaneous emission triggers a chain reaction.

Use the variables at the top of PromptCriticality.py enclosed within the '## === SETUP ===' comments to change parameters.

Can be considered a remake of Critical Assembly Simulator by Alex Wellerstein (https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/misc/criticality/), but this one has partial neutron reflection and reflector disintegration threshold. I wasn't trying to make a remake, but there is only so many ways to simulate this without doing it with continuum and statistics.
